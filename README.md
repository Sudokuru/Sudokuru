# hint Object Properties
## Example 1: Amend Notes
![Example 1](https://sudokuru.s3.amazonaws.com/hintExample1-V2.png)
### strategy
```json
"AMEND_NOTES"
```
Name of strategy used by the hint. Amend notes works removing all notes from a cell then adding back in just the ones that don't conflict with placed values in the same row, column, and box as the cell. In the picture the cell with the red border was previously empty and amend notes was able to add in the 2 and 8 only as the others conflicted with the highlighted cells.
### cause
```json
[[7,4],[7,5],[7,6],[7,8],[4,2],[8,0],[8,1]]
```
Coordinates of cells that "cause" strategy to be applicable. This is a 2d array so cause[0] is [7, 4] referring to the cell with the 9 highlighted in blue in the next to last row (rows and columns are zero-indexed). cause[0][0] refers to it being in the 8th row and cause[0][1] refers to it being in the 5th column. Similarly the last cell cause[6] is the highlighted 3 that it shares a box with.
### groups
```json
[[0,7],[1,2],[2,6]]
```
Group type and index of groups that "cause strategy". This is a 2d array so group[0] is [0, 7] referring to the next to next to last row with green borders. group[0][0] refers to the group type (0 = row, 1 = column, 2 = box) and group[0][1] refers to it being the 8th row. Similarly the last group group[2] is the bottom left box whose cells also have green borders.
### placements
```json
[]
```
Row, column, and values for cells that have had values placed in them as result of strategy. This does not apply to this strategy.
### removals
```json
[[7,2,1,3,4,5,6,7,9]]
```
Notes that can be removed from cells along with their row and columns. The first two values represent the row and column respectively so removals[0][0] and removals[0][1] refer to the 3rd cell in the 8th row. The rest of the numbers in the subarray are the notes to be removed which is every number but 2 and 8. Amend notes is unique in that every note that shouldn't be removed should be added back in (2 and 8 in this example). In this example the cell had no notes in it before amend notes.
### info
```json
"Amend notes are when you reset a cell's notes to contain every nonconflicting number"
```

Row, column, and values for cells that have had values placed in them as result of strategy. This does not apply to this strategy.
### removals
```json
[[1,0,8]]
```
Notes that can be removed from cells along with their row and columns. The first two values represent the row and column respectively so removals[0][0] and removals[0][1] refer to the 1st cell in the 2nd row. The rest of the numbers in the subarray are the notes to be removed which is just 8.

## Example 5: Other Obvious Sets
### strategy
```json
"OBVIOUS_TRIPLET"
```
### strategy
```json
"OBVIOUS_QUADRUPLET"

Note: while cells in say a obvious quadruplet must share the same 4 notes the 4 cells don't have to individually have all 4 notes they just can't have any other notes.
## Example 6: Hidden Single
![Example 6](https://sudokuru.s3.amazonaws.com/hintExample5-V1.png)
### strategy
```json
"HIDDEN_SINGLE"
```
Name of strategy used by the hint. Hidden single works by having only one cell in a group that still has a number as a possibility in which case all other notes can be removed from it. This is shown by the 8 obvious single which in the only 8 note in the box with the green border. Therefore, the other notes highlighted in red can be removed.
### cause
```json
[[3,8],[4,8],[5,6],[5,8]]
```
Coordinates of cells that "cause" strategy to be applicable. This is a 2d array so cause[0] is [3, 8] referring to the 9th cell in the 4th row (rows and columns are zero-indexed). cause[0][0] refers to it being in the 4th row and cause[0][1] refers to it being in the 9th column.
### groups

# PuzzleData Object Properties
## solution
81 character string representing the solution to the puzzle (left to right top to bottom)
## difficulty
Number representing the difficulty of the puzzle (higher is harder)
## givensCount
Number representing the number of givens i.e. pre-filled cells in the puzzle
## puzzleStrategies
Boolean array representing which strategies were used to solve the puzzle in following order (subset of StrategyEnum):
- 0: OBVIOUS_SINGLE,
- 1: HIDDEN_SINGLE,
- 2: OBVIOUS_PAIR,
- 3: HIDDEN_PAIR,
- 4: POINTING_PAIR,
- 5: OBVIOUS_TRIPLET,
- 6: HIDDEN_TRIPLET,
- 7: POINTING_TRIPLET,
- 8: OBVIOUS_QUADRUPLET,
- 9: HIDDEN_QUADRUPLET,
## drills
- 1D number array representing last time strategy can be reasonably used as drill or -1 if it can't be used as a drill
- Each index is defined as the puzzle when it has a certain number of cells filled in (so index 30 has 30 cells filled in including givens).
- Reasonably is defined as to mean removing strategies if they overlap with their prereqs (i.e. if a obvious pair is made up of two obvious singles the pair will be excluded) and not counting a strategy if multiple instances of it are present so their is only one correct answer.
- The same number index to strategy mapping as puzzleStrategies is used.
